### Commit Guidelines

We follow conventional commits for clear communication. Format:
```
<type>(<scope>): <description>
```

#### Commit Types
- **feat**: New features
- **fix**: Bug fixes
- **refactor**: Code refactoring
- **chore**: Build process or auxiliary tool changes

#### Examples
```
feat(auth): implement user authentication
fix(api): resolve data fetching issue
refactor(database): optimize queries
```

// ...existing code...

### Pull Request Process (when a feature is complete)
1. Update your branch
   - git fetch origin (Sync Branch if any updates)

2. Run checks locally (If provided any)
   - npm test
   - npm run lint
   - npm run build

3. Clean commits
   - Squash or fix WIP commits so history is tidy
   - Use conventional commit style: type(scope): short description
     - e.g. feat(auth): add login, fix(api): correct user fetch

4. Push your branch
   - git push origin your-branch

5. Open the Pull Request
   - Title: use conventional commit style (same format as commits)
   - Description: what you changed, why, how to test, related issue (if any)

6. Address review feedback
   - Make changes on the same branch, commit, push
   - Reply to reviewers when done

7. Merge & cleanup (after approval and CI pass)
   - Merge per project policy (squash/rebase/merge)
   - git checkout main && git pull
   - git push origin --delete your-branch
